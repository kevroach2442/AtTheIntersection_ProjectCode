# AtTheIntersection_ProjectCode
This repository includes the code underlying the At the Intersection project.
This repository includes 3 files.
1. R code showing the data processing for the traffic stops in CT.
2. A Stata Do-file showing the data processing for the traffic stops in IL.
3. R code for the analysis and visualization of results (including robustness checks).  I'd suggest looking at parts 1 and 3 of this code to get an idea of how the models are run and how the visulaizations are created.  

The final paper was published in JREP and can be found here. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/at-the-intersection-race-gender-and-discretion-in-police-traffic-stop-outcomes/2C7329D70147351D843E50B4C1A47CDE
